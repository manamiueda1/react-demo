Functional VS Class Components

Functional component -> stateless component and used to be a static component

class component -> stateful component
class methods -> You can define methods/functions inside a class funciton

instantiating a class function -> class Developer() would be instantiated using the 'new' key word: new Developer()

Why do we want to use a class component? -> React has given us the ability to write code with a lot more functionality on them

class components gives us access to the render() menthod and constructor() method and allows access state

constructor() -> Each class function has a constructor where that takes in parameters. State lives inside the constructor

super() -> used to call the parent constructor. If you want to use this.props, you need to pass in props into the super()

React hooks -> allows access to state in functional components
