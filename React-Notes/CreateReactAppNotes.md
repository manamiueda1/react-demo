# Create React App Notes

Create React App -> Tool built by Facebook that help developers get started on building a React project. Create React App has all of the configurations done for us, has all files and dependencies set up so we can start using React right away.

React is written in a version of JavaScript that is further along than the JavaScript version that the browser understands/uses.

2 tools: babel and webpack -> these two tools convert JavaScript written in React and converts them into an older version of JavaScript so the browser is able to understand the code.

Babel -> makes sure that our javascript files work on all browsers no matter how new/old the browser versions are.

webpack -> module bundler. Takes all the JavaScrict files and bundle everything together and optimizes for production

package.json -> package manager. we can install other React Components into package.json.

importing React in js file-> allows us to write JSX: html like syntax

Importing ReactDOM in js file -> Allows React to interact with the DOM. It connects App component with the DOM (html file)

What are node modules -> where npm modules are saved. If you open node_modules , you should see a folder named react , which contains the code that makes React run.

App.js -> where you compile all of your components
